# Dogs vs Cats Image Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying images of dogs and cats using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal is to develop a model that can accurately distinguish between images of dogs and cats.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Dogs vs Cats" dataset, downloaded from Kaggle. It consists of 25,000 labeled images of dogs and cats.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction. Batch normalization and dropout layers are utilized for regularization. The final layer uses a sigmoid activation function to output the probability of an image belonging to the "dog" class.

## Training Process
- The dataset is split into training and validation sets.
- Images are resized to 256x256 pixels and normalized.
- The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.
- Training is conducted for 10 epochs, monitoring both training and validation accuracy.

## Results
- After training, the model achieves a validation accuracy of approximately 74.66%.
- Training and validation accuracy and loss curves are visualized using matplotlib.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directory.
3. Install the required libraries.
4. Execute the Jupyter Notebook `Cats-vs-Dogs-classification.ipynb` to train the model and visualize the results.
5. Experiment with different hyperparameters and model architectures for further improvements.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different CNN architectures, such as transfer learning with pre-trained models.
- Augment the dataset with additional images to improve generalization.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
